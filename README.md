# VisualCube
Generate custom Rubik's cube visualisations from your browser address bar. 

### Installation Instructions

These instructions are for installing the script on your own web server. If you do not have access to your own server, or would just like to try out the software, please visit:
http://cube.crider.co.uk/visualcube.php

##### Docker integration

If you want to run VisualCube locally or on the server but you don't want to install PHP, is a good idea to deploy app as a Docker container.
To build your own Docker image run from the root of the repository:
```sh
$ docker build -t visual-cube .
```

And then create a container locally with exposed port 80 (for HTTP):
```sh
$ docker run --rm -p 80:80 visual-cube
```

Go to address `http://localhost/visualcube.php` in your browser.

##### Prerequisites

* Access to an Apache web server with PHP and ImageMagic installed.
* A MySQL database. This is optional, but will improve performance if you have a high traffic website.

##### Steps

1. Download and extract the code into a web-accessible folder.
2. Edit the configuration variables in visualcube_config.php
3. Point your browser to: www.yourwebsite.com/visualcube.php
4. (Optional) Edit DB_USER, DB_PASS and DB_NAME in visualcube_dbprune.sh and install the cron job.
5. (Optional) Configure mod_rewrite to redirect image suffixes to corresponding fmt=xxx form. See below.

##### Configuring mod_rewrite
Add a .htaccess file to the same folder as visualcube.php with something like the following:
```
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.example\.com)$
RewriteRule ^visualcube\.(gif|png|jpg|jpeg|tiff|ico)$ http://www.example.com/visualcube.php?%{QUERY_STRING}&fmt=$1 [L]
```
